My name is James Smith. I like programming and making games. Some of my
projects are on my github page.

I don't like webdesign: it's tedious. So I'm using the default Jekyll theme.
Deal with it.

I'm going to try to get into blogging. Yeah. If you're interested in that kind
of thing, maybe come back later?
